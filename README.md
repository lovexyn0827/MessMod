A Minecraft mod that contains many features ranging from world 
manipulation and information providing to bug fixes and so on, allowing 
you to take more control of the game, see more information, and do some 
work easier.

Just like what the name says, the Mod contains functions in many fields, therefore the Mod seems to be messy, and even the style of the source code is messy.

In other languages:

[简体中文](https://github.com/lovexyn0827/MessMod/blob/master/README_zh_cn.md)

## Highlights

- More accurate hitboxes than ones on the vanilla client.
- Tool items which make using `/tick` more convenient.
- Real-time display of entity information.
- Controlling the game at the level of the source code.
- Multifunctional accessing paths.
- 8 easy-to-use renderers (see below).
- Exporting given areas as a new save.
- Undo / Redoing changes to blocks with `Ctrl + Z` and `Ctrl + Y`.
- Chunk grid generation.
- Fake lazy loaded chunks.
- And more...

## Requirements

- Fabric Loader 0.8.0+. 
- The fabric-carpet by gnembon. (Strongly recommended, but not necessary) 
- Minecraft 1.16.4/1.16.5/1.17.1/1.18.2/1.19.4/1.20.1
- Everything Minecraft requires. 

## Commands

Names of arguments are wrapped by pointy semicolons, and optional components are wrapped by squared semicolons.

### Accessing Path Settings

##### `/accessingpath compile <name> <inputType>`

Compile the custom node with the given `<name>` into bytecode to increase the performance. The expected input type of nodes may be specified with the argument `<inputType>`, in the format `pkg1/Class1,pkg2/Class2`, and the input type of the first node must be a reference type. 

Currently, this feature may be buggy.

##### `/accessingpath defineNode <name> <temproary> <backend>`

Define the accessing path specified by the argument <backend> as a custom accessing path node. If <temproary> is false, the node will be saved in the world folder.

##### `/accessingpath list`

List all custom nodes.

##### `/accessingpath undefineNode <name>`

Delete the custom node with the given `<name>`.

### Entity Counting

##### `/countentities [<selector>]`

Get the number of entities selected by `<selector>`， or the total entity count of the current dimension if `<selector>` is not given.

##### `/countentities <selector> <stackedWith>`

Get the number of entities selected by `<selector>`  and at the same position as the entity selected by `<stackedWith>`.

##### `/countentities <selector> <stackedWith> <maxDistanceVec>`

Get the number of entities which is selected by `<selector>` and whose distance to `<stackedWith>` on each axis is smaller than the corresponding component of `<maxDistanceVec>`.

##### `/countentities <selector> <stackedWith> <maxDistance>`

Get the number of entities which is selected by `<selector>` and whose distance to `<stackedWith>` is smaller than `<maxDistance>`.

### Block State Checking

##### `/ensure <pos>`

Get the information of block state and block entity data (if exists) at `<pos>` to check if the block is rendered wrongly or is a ghost block.

### Entity Behavior Setting

##### `/entityconfig <targets> enableStepHeight|disableStepHeight`

Make `<targets>` can/cannot step on blocks directly.

##### `/entityconfig localPlayer enableStepHeight|disableStepHeight`

Similar to the last, but the target is always the local player. 

### Access Java Fields Of Entities

##### `/entityfield <target> get <fieldName> [<path>]`

Get the value of `<field>` in the object that corresponds to `<target>`, an accessing path can be specified if needed. Note that if the mapping is not loaded, the names here are intermediary names like `field_18276`, which are hard to be understood, please use a mapping to translate them to readable names. 

##### `/entityfield <target> listAvailableFields`

List all fields defined or inherited by the class of `<target>`. 

##### `/entityfield <target> set <fieldName> <newValue> [<path>]`

Set the value of `<field>` in the object which represents `<target>` to `<newValue>`. Check the document on literals in accessing paths for the format of `<newValue>`. Using an accessing path to specify to where the new value is written.

### Entity Information Logger

##### `/entitylog sub <target> [policy]`

Start recording the Motion, position, and listened fields of `<target>` every tick and save them to a CSV file. Note that some of the records will temporarily be saved to a buffer rather than being written to the file immediately, `/entity flush` could be used to flush recent changes. 

Logs are saved to the `entitylog` folder in the world folder, with a name like the one below:

 `2023-08-19_17-12-21@12-C-villager.csv`

The time when the log file is created is given before '@', and after that, the numerical ID of the entity, the side to process the log ('C' for 'client', 'S' for 'Server', and 'M' for 'Mixed') and the name or the type ID of the entity, respectively, are given.

A storage policy could also be specified, whose possible values are the following: 

- `SERVER_ONLY`: Only data produced by the server is recorded.
- `CLIENT_ONLY`: Only data produced by the client is recorded.
- `SEPARATED`: The data produced by both the server and the client will be recorded, and saved in two separate files.
- `MIXED`: The data produced by both the server and the client will be recorded, and saved in a single file.

##### `/entitylog unsub <target>`

Stop monitoring `<target>` and save the records in the buffer to the disk.

##### `/entitylog listenfield <entityType> <field> [<name> [<whereToUpdate>] [<path>]]`

Mark `<field>` as 'listened' so that its value will be recorded if any entity containing this field is subscribed by using `/entitylog sub <target>`. Currently, `<type>` wouldn't restrict the scope of influence of this command.

Move the entity using `Entity.move()`. The displacement is given in argument `<delta>`. Usually, "self" should be used as the last argument. After the execution, the actual displacement of the entity is outputted.

##### `/moventity <targets> <delta> projectile`

Move the entity in the way projectile entities move. The displacement is given in argument `<delta>`. The command seems to be buggy now.

### Name Entities Conveniently

##### `/namentity <entities> <name>`

Name selected entities.

### Kill A Part Of Entities

##### `/partlykill <entities> <possibility>`

Kill a part of selected entities.

### POI Searching & Visualization

##### `/poi scanCobic <corner1> <corner2> <type>`

Find POIs with the given type in a Cube whose two opposite corners are given in the command. 

##### `/poi set <pos> <type> <replace>`

Set the POI(Point of Interest) at `<pos>` to `<type>` if there is no POI at `<pos>` or `<replace>` is true. 

##### `/poi visualize <center> <radius> <type>`

Visualize POIs whose to `<center>` is within `<radius>`(in meter) and have a given`<type>`. All visualized entities will be rendered as a green cube, and if the POI has been occupied, it will have a red frame.

### Raycast Simulation

##### `/raycast blocks <from> <to> [visual]`

Check if the direction-ed line between two points given in the command is blocked by any block, in the way most projectiles check for collisions. After execution, the coordination of checked blocks will be output, and if the line was blocked, the coordination of the block that blocked the line, the face that blocked the line, and the coordination of the point where the line was blocked will be output. If visual is present, the process of the checking will be visualized, that is, all grids which checked blocks are in is displayed in light green, the colliding shape of the block which blocked the line is displayed in orange, the grid the block is in is displayed in purple, the part of the unblocked line is displayed in magenta and the blocked part is displayed in red.

Here is an example: 

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/lovexyn0827/MessMod/media/raycast-block.png)

##### `/raycast entities <from> <to> <expand> <excludeSender> [visual]`

Check if the direction-ed line between two points given in the command is blocked by any entity, in the way most projectiles check for collisions. After the execution, if the line was blocked, the type or the custom name of the entity that blocked the line and the coordination of the point where the line was blocked will be output. The argument `<expand>` determines the range of checking, which should be one-half of the width of the bounding box of the projectile plus 1 in projectile collision checking simulations.

## Key Binds

**`F3 + E`**: Toggle the HUD containing the information of the entity that the player is looking at. 

**`F3 + M`**: Toggle the HUD containing the information of the local player. 

**`F3 + S`**: Toggle the HUD containing the information of the server-side player. 

**`Ctrl + Z`**: Undo block placement or breaking. (Requires `blockPlacementHistory`)

**`Ctrl+ Y`**: Redo block placement or breaking. (Requires `blockPlacementHistory`)

**`Ctrl + C`**: Output the NBT data of the targeted entity or the command to summon such an entity. (requires `dumpTargetEntityDataWithCtrlC`)

## Renderers

#### Entity information HUD

Information about the entity that the player is looking at is obtained at the end of server ticks, and the information about the local player is obtained at the end of client ticks. Further discussion on them are available in the next section.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/lovexyn0827/MessMod/media/HUD-demo.png)

#### Explosion rays

It renders the lines between the center of an explosion and some chosen points in the hitbox of entities affected by the explosion, which determines how much damage the entities will take, how much the velocity of the entity will change, etc. 

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/lovexyn0827/MessMod/media/explosion-ray-demo.png)

#### Server-side hitboxes

Don't always believe the hitboxes provided by F3 + B because they are adjusted by the client to make movements smoother and move slower than the one on the server when the entity is moving. Sometimes vanilla hitboxes could even be missing if the server has experienced a very long tick but the client hasn't.

Display the loading state of chunks. Entity processing chunks, lazy load chunks and other chunks have a cube, with a color of red, green and grey, displayed on the top of its center. Requires enabling `chunkLoadingInfoRenderer` and holding a nautilus shell.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/lovexyn0827/MessMod/media/chunk-loading-status.png)

## Tool Items (requires fabric-carpet and enabledTools)

## HUD Lines

#### Predefined Data

**`Header line`**: Include the ID (usually equals to the number of Entity instances created before the entity is loaded), name (custom name or the type used in /summon), and age (ticks since the entity is loaded).  

**`Pos`**: The position of the entity.

**`Motion`**: The value of field motion (MCP), velocity (Yarn), or deltaMovement (Offical) of the entity. 

**`Delta`**: The displacement of the entity in the last tick. It can be treated as the velocity.

**`Yaw, Pitch`**:The direction the entity is facing.

**`Fall Distance`**: The distance the entity has fallen since the last time the entity left the ground, but it can be influenced by various factors like water and lava.

**`General State`**: Some boolean states that are available in all entities. More information can be found below.

**`Fuse`**: The length of a TNT's fuse, or the number of ticks before its explosion.

**`Pose`**: The pose of the entity, usually standing.

**`Power`**: The acceleration of a fireball. Note: A fireball has a drag of 0.05gt^(-1), so the fireball won't accelerate forever.

**`Velocity Decay`**: The drag of a boat, which varies when the boat is on different grounds. 

#### Shorten States

##### General

**`Gl`**: Rendered with a glowing outline.

**`Inv`**: Won't be affected by most damages.

**`Fly`**: The entity is fall flying, using an elytra.

**`Slp`**: The entity is sleeping.

**`Dead`**: The entity's health is zero or lower, meaning the entity is dead. 

## Accessing Paths

See the [wiki](https://github.com/lovexyn0827/MessMod/wiki/Accessing-Path).

## Options In Entity Selectors

#### `id`

Possible values: An integer or a range, just like the `level` option in the vanilla entity selector.

Select entities with numeric IDs (field `entityId`, `networkId`) that match the given one or are within the given range.

#### `side`

Possible values: `client` or `server`

Where the entities are selected from. Note that this feature is not thread-safe, so it should be used in some simple commands without side effects (in other words, commands that only read something but don't write).

Only available in single-player games.

#### `typeRegex`

Possible values: A quoted regular expression.

Specify a regular expression matching the ID (including the namespace) of selected entities.

#### `nameRegex`

Possible values: A quoted regular expression.

Specify a regular expression matching the name of selected entities.

#### `class`

Possible values: A quoted regular expression.

Specify a regular expression matching the class (package name is optional) of selected entities.

## Mapping Loading

1. If Minecraft is deobfuscated, the mapping won't be loaded.
2. Check the `mapping` folder for corresponding mapping (i.e.`<mcversion>.tiny`, like `1.16.4.tiny`).
3. Otherwise, try to download the latest compatible mapping from Fabric's official maven repository.
4. Otherwise, if the TIS Carpet Addition is loaded, try to load its bundled mapping.
5. Otherwise, the mapping won't be loaded.

## Advanced Mixins

Some mixins is this Mod may bring about significant performance cost and may has unexpected impact on the vanilla multi-thread mechanism. Therefore, these mixins are optional. By default, all advanced mixins are enabled. If you want to disable some advanced mixins, you can press F8 (not available on MacOS) in the title screen or edit `advanced_mixins.prop` in the game directory. Note that modifications to advanced mixin configurations requires a restart to take effect.

Disabling advanced mixins may make related features no longer available.

## Other Features

- Stacktrace will be printed when the Carpet Mod is not loaded. If the Carpet Mod is loaded, enabling the `superSecretSetting` has the same effect.
- A warning screen is popped when trying to open a survival with MessMod installed for the first time.
- Players can select entities targeted by the crosshair with entity selector `@t`.

## Notice

- The mod is still in development, some feature is not available or buggy, please tell me if you find something working not properly. 
- Dedicated servers are not supported well currently and there are many unsolved bugs related to the connection between the server and the client, so only use the mod in single-player mode or the host client of a LAN server. 
- Some commands like /explode ~ ~ ~ 2147483647 true can freeze the server, be careful.
- The Mod is not intended to be used in survival saves, as it may break vanilla mechanisms or enable the players to cheat accidentally, especially when some options are modified. To ensure this, the option `hideSurvivalSaves` could be enabled.
- To minimumize potential impact on the game and make the usage of this mod as convenient as possible, almost no measures are taken to check if any operation can cause server crashes or any other serious impacts,  so using the Mod only on singleplayer mode or servers played by trusted players.

## About

Initially, I started this mod in Feb 2021 to do some research on the motion of entities, thus the HUDs, bounding box renderer, tool items and command `/entityfield` were the earliest features of this mod. Later, more features were introduced gradually when needed.

After April 2022, I speeded up the development of the mod, more features were added while many previously added ones were completely refactored. By 2023/08/20, 28 commands, 70 options (or rules) and 9 renderers had been available.
